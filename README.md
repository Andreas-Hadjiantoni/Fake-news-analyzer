# Twitter Fake News Analyzer


This project was my BSc Thesis. It was an open ended project, and the goal was to discover as
many properties as possible for an iranian fake news dataset released by Twitter. The dataset
was interpreted as a user graph for the purposes of this project.

## Algorithms implemented:

  - PageRank.
  - Clustering of highly connected nodes.
  - Betweenness Centrality of nodes.
